## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before installing Trivy, you should know your platform. Trivy runs on various Linux distributions, including:
- **RHEL/CentOS**
- **Ubuntu/Debian**
- **Arch Linux**
- **macOS**
- **Nix**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Trivy

### Install required packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get install wget apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release
```
> Install package from HTTPS with gnupg which contains software for encryption and authentication

Explanation:
- `wget` - for downloading files
- `apt-transport-https` - for HTTPS support in APT
- `gnupg` - for encryption and authentication
- `lsb-release` - for determining the Linux distribution version

### Download and add the Trivy GPG key:
```bash
wget -qO - https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/trivy-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Explanation:
- Downloads the Trivy public key and converts it to a format usable by APT.

### Add the Trivy repository:
```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/trivy-archive-keyring.gpg] https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list > /dev/null
```

Explanation:
- Adds Trivy‚Äôs repository to the system. The `$(lsb_release -cs)` automatically inserts your current Ubuntu distribution codename.

### Update and install Trivy:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install trivy
```

## Ways to minimize vulnerability

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Using the latest version of packages
Always update to the latest version:
```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```
> Using the latest version package is vital for security. When images are updated, they do security patch. Therefore, updating version package is important

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Alpine image
Alpine images are smaller, thus reducing potential vulnerabilities:
```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-alpine AS build
```
> When we use Alpine image, we can downsize the size of image. That means we can minimize the vulnerability of package.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization through build stages
Distribute builds and application dependencies using multi-stage builds:
```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN javac Main.java

FROM openjdk:17-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/Main.class /app/
CMD ["java", "Main"]
```
> Distribute build and application which really need for operating system. It helps to lose weight image and strengthen security factors

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Eliminate unnecessary files
Use a `.dockerignore` file to remove files that are not needed:
```plaintext
*.log
*.tmp
.git
/tests/
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
```
> Using .dockerignore file, we can delete files which are not necessary. Therefore, it helps to minimize the size of image and impove effectivity of image.

# üõ†Ô∏è Practice: Downsize Vulnerabilities & Set Automation

### Setting up Automation

The code provided below automates the vulnerability scanning process. It uses Trivy to scan for **HIGH-level** vulnerabilities. If the vulnerabilities exceed 5, an email alert is sent. The image is then optimized using multi-stage builds, re-scanned, and a final result is emailed.

### Major Workflow:
1. Vulnerability Scanning with Trivy (`check_trivy_vulnerabilities`)
2. Sending Email Alerts (`send_alert`)
3. Image Optimization (Multi-stage Build) (`optimize_image`)
4. Re-scan the Optimized Image
5. Send Final Result via Email

---

## üìÑ Code Explanation:

### üîç Vulnerability Scanning with Trivy (`check_trivy_vulnerabilities`)

```python
def check_trivy_vulnerabilities(image_name):
    try:
        # Executes the Trivy command and retrieves the results in JSON format
        trivy_output = os.popen(f"trivy image --severity HIGH --format json {image_name}").read()
        trivy_data = json.loads(trivy_output)
        
        # Filters out only HIGH severity vulnerabilities from the list
        vulnerabilities = trivy_data.get('Results', [])[0].get('Vulnerabilities', [])
        high_vulns = [vuln for vuln in vulnerabilities if vuln['Severity'] == 'HIGH']
        
        return high_vulns  # Returns only HIGH severity vulnerabilities
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error running Trivy scan: {e}")
        return None  # Returns None if an error occurs
```
### Input
  -  image_name is the Docker image to be scanned by Trivy.
### Process
  - Uses os.popen() to run the Trivy scan and filters out only the HIGH severity vulnerabilities.
### Output
  - Returns a list containing only the HIGH severity vulnerabilities.
---
### ‚úâÔ∏è Sending Email Alerts (`send_alert`)

```python
def send_alert(image_name, high_vulns, stage="initial"):
    from_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
    to_email = "recipient_email@gmail.com"
    password = "password"  # Use environment variables for security.

    # Set the email subject
    subject = f"Alert: Docker Image {image_name} - {stage.capitalize()}"
    
    # Create the email body
    body = ""
    if stage == "initial":
        body += f"Warning: Docker image {image_name} has {len(high_vulns)} HIGH vulnerabilities.

"
    elif stage == "optimized":
        body += f"The image {image_name} has been optimized.
Current HIGH vulnerabilities: {len(high_vulns)}.

"

    # Structure vulnerability details into a table
    if high_vulns:
        table = PrettyTable()
        table.field_names = ["Vulnerability ID", "Package Name", "Installed Version", "Fixed Version", "Severity"]
        for vuln in high_vulns:
            vid = vuln.get("VulnerabilityID", "N/A")
            pkg_name = vuln.get("PkgName", "N/A")
            installed_version = vuln.get("InstalledVersion", "N/A")
            fixed_version = vuln.get("FixedVersion", "N/A")
            severity = vuln.get("Severity", "N/A")
            table.add_row([vid, pkg_name, installed_version, fixed_version, severity])
        
        body += f"Here are the details of the HIGH vulnerabilities:

{table}
"

    # Set up the email
    message = MIMEMultipart()
    message['From'] = from_email
    message['To'] = to_email
    message['Subject'] = subject
    message.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    try:
        # Send the email
        with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587) as server:
            server.starttls()  # Activate TLS encryption
            server.login(from_email, password)  # Login to Gmail
            server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, message.as_string())
            print(f"Email alert sent to {to_email}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email: {e}")
```
### Input:
- **image_name**: The name of the Docker image to be displayed in the email.
- **high_vulns**: A list of HIGH severity vulnerabilities obtained from Trivy.
- **stage**: Identifies whether the scan is from the initial stage or after optimization.

### Process:
- Structures vulnerability details into a table using `PrettyTable`.
- Sends the email containing the vulnerability information.

### Output:
- An email alert is sent containing the vulnerability details.

### üõ† Image Optimization (Multi-stage Build)

This function optimizes the Docker image by applying multi-stage builds. It first builds the source code and dependencies, then only copies the necessary files into the final lightweight image.

```python
def optimize_image(image_name):
    print("Optimizing the Docker image using multi-stage build...")

    dockerfile_content = '''
    # Build stage
    FROM openjdk:17-alpine AS build

    # Update to the latest version of packages
    RUN apk update && apk upgrade --no-cache

    # Copy the source code
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .

    # Build the source code
    RUN javac Main.java

    # Final stage - Use a lightweight image for optimization
    FROM openjdk:17-alpine

    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the build artifacts
    COPY --from=build /app/Main.class /app/

    # Run the application
    CMD ["java", "Main"]
    '''

    # Create Dockerfile
    with open("Dockerfile", "w") as f:
        f.write(dockerfile_content)

    # Build the image without using cache
    os.system(f"docker build --no-cache -t {image_name}_optimized .")
```

### Input:
- **image_name**: The name of the Docker image to be optimized.

### Process:
- Builds the source code using Alpine base images for a smaller size.
- Copies only the necessary files into the final stage to minimize the image size.

### Output:
- Builds the optimized Docker image.
---
### üîÑ Main Logic

This section controls the overall process:

- Runs Trivy to check for HIGH severity vulnerabilities.
- If the vulnerabilities exceed 5, sends an email alert.
- Optimizes the Docker image.
- Re-scans the optimized image and sends the results via email.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    image_name = "castlehoo/my-java-app:1.0"
    
    # Scans for vulnerabilities with Trivy (HIGH severity only)
    high_vulns = check_trivy_vulnerabilities(image_name)

    if high_vulns is not None:
        print(f"Image {image_name} has {len(high_vulns)} HIGH vulnerabilities.")
        if len(high_vulns) > 5:
            # Sends an email alert if vulnerabilities exceed 5
            send_alert(image_name, high_vulns, stage="initial")
            
            # Optimize the image
            optimize_image(image_name)
            
            # Re-scan the optimized image with Trivy
            optimized_image_name = f"{image_name}_optimized"
            optimized_high_vulns = check_trivy_vulnerabilities(optimized_image_name)
            
            if optimized_high_vulns is not None:
                print(f"Optimized image {optimized_image_name} has {len(optimized_high_vulns)} HIGH vulnerabilities.")
                send_alert(optimized_image_name, optimized_high_vulns, stage="optimized")
            else:
                print(f"Failed to check vulnerabilities for optimized image {optimized_image_name}")
        else:
            print(f"Image {image_name} has acceptable HIGH vulnerabilities ({len(high_vulns)}).")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to check vulnerabilities for image {image_name}")
```
